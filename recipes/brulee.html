    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
      An outstandingly simple yet exquisite desert, creme brulee is an outstanding option as a 
      sweet, light dish that can be prepared in batches if necessary. Utilizing just eggs, sugar, 
      vanilla and salt, this french classic proves to easily impress guests at a party or function.
    </p>
    <p>
      This recipe details how to prepare the custard for the creme brulee, in addition to outlining 
      a safer option to create the carmelized sugar surface on top rather than using a propane torch. 
      All that is required are small ramekins to allow the custard to set in, and an oven with a broiler 
      or broil function!
