    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>As one of the more tender, delicate choices of fish available to consumers, 
      salmon is an incredibly versatile meal that can be enjoyed in countless styles
      of preparation.
    </p>
    <p>
      This recipe details how to prepare and sear a salmon filet on the stove in any large
      non-stick pan, as well as offers an excellent honey garlic glaze to enjoy the
      fish with. This recipe can be accompanied by countless sides, my favorites for this
      particular recipe being roasted petite potatoes, sauteed vegetables and/or steamed rice.
